## About Myers-Briggs | History and Research

This page provides an overview of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), including its history, theoretical foundations, four core dimensions, research background, and the 16 personality types. It is designed as part of a modern web application using reusable components.



## Overview

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality framework based on the theory of psychological types. This page explains:

- The historical origins of the MBTI  
- The four core personality dimensions  
- Research and validity information  
- The 16 personality types  
- Website creator information  



## History & Origins

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is based on the theory of psychological types developed by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung in 1921. Jung believed that apparent random variation in human behavior is not actually random, but flows from differences in how people prefer to use their perception and judgment.

In the 1940s, Katherine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers built upon Jung's work to create a practical personality framework. They developed the MBTI to make Jung's theory accessible and useful for everyday life, career development, and personal understanding.

Katherine became interested in personality type psychology after reading Jung's work. Isabel, a novelist and researcher, recognized the value of understanding personality types for educational purposes. Together, they conducted extensive research and created the framework that became the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.



## The Four Dimensions

The MBTI framework is built on four dichotomies:

### 1. Extraversion vs. Introversion (E/I)

This dimension describes where you direct your energy and how you gain motivation.

- Extraverts (E) direct their energy toward the outer world of people and activities.  
- Introverts (I) prefer the inner world of ideas and reflection.  

This distinction is not about shyness or sociability, but about where you prefer to focus your attention and gain energy.

### 2. Sensing vs. Intuition (S/N)

This dimension addresses how you gather information and perceive the world.

- Sensors (S) focus on concrete, factual information gathered through the senses — what is real and present.  
- Intuitive types (N) focus on patterns, possibilities, and the bigger picture — what could be.  

Sensors are often detail-oriented and practical, while intuitive types are imaginative and future-focused.

### 3. Thinking vs. Feeling (T/F)

This dimension describes how you make decisions.

- Thinking (T) types make decisions based on objective logic, analysis, and principles.  
- Feeling (F) types make decisions based on personal values, relationships, and the impact on others.  

Both approaches are rational but prioritize different criteria: tasks and logic versus people and values.

### 4. Judging vs. Perceiving (J/P)

This dimension describes your preferred lifestyle and approach to structure.

- Judging (J) types prefer structure, planning, and organization.  
- Perceiving (P) types prefer flexibility, spontaneity, and adaptability.  

Neither preference is better; they reflect different ways of organizing life and responding to the world.



## Research & Validity

The MBTI has become one of the world's most widely used personality assessments, applied in personal development, career planning, team building, leadership development, and education.

Over 70 years of research has examined its reliability, validity, and practical applications.

The MBTI is particularly valuable for:

- Understanding personal strengths and areas for growth  
- Improving communication and relationships  
- Career development and identifying fulfilling work  
- Team building and organizational development  
- Leadership and management training  
- Educational planning and learning styles  

It is important to note that the MBTI measures preferences, not intelligence, ability, or skill. Individuals use all eight preferences to some degree, though most people show natural tendencies toward certain ones.



## The 16 Personality Types

The combination of four preferences results in 16 unique personality types. Each type has distinct characteristics, values, strengths, and potential growth areas.

Your type represents your natural preferences and may shift somewhat over time or across contexts. The framework is designed to promote self-awareness and appreciation of personality differences rather than to label or limit individuals.

Understanding these differences can support self-acceptance, stronger interpersonal relationships, and more effective collaboration.
